For my part of this project, I worked on Part 1, which focused on building and testing the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for the Faculty and Course tables. I used DB Browser for SQLite to open and manage the database, and IntelliJ IDEA to write and test the Java code that connects and updates the SQLite tables. I verified that both tables could add, read, and update records correctly from the console, and made sure everything stayed consistent with the Student table’s existing format. All SQL queries were tested, and the database changes were confirmed directly in DB Browser.
